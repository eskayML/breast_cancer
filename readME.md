# Breast Cancer Detection App

The breast cancer detection app is a machine learning application that utilizes Scikit-learn to train a predictive model. The model is trained on a dataset of tabular data containing various features associated with breast cancer. The features are used to train the model to predict whether a given case is benign or malignant .The machine  application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to healthcare professionals, allowing them to quickly and accurately diagnose breast cancer using this powerful predictive tool. It has a performance of  97% accuracy on a hold-out test set.


## Data Collection 
The UCI Machine Learning Breast Cancer dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for binary classification tasks. It contains information about breast cancer tumors, including attributes such as size, shape, and texture. There are a total of 569 instances in the dataset, with 212 malignant and 357 benign cases
